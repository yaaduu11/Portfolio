            I build systems the way some people solve puzzles—by tinkering, testing, and tearing things down to understand what truly makes them tick.
            <br /><br />
            As a full-stack engineer, I work across modern web technologies—proficient in Node.js, React.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Next.js, Redux, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Socket.IO, and WebRTC.
            <br /><br />
            My journey into tech began in 12th grade with C++, and since then, I’ve grown into a developer with hands-on experience across the entire stack—from frontend interfaces to backend infrastructure.
            <br /><br />
            I have strong architectural understanding of Microservices, Repository and MVC design patterns, and practical experience integrating distributed systems with Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. I'm also skilled in database design and have integrated services such as Razorpay, Stripe, Cloudinary, Firebase, NodeMailer, OAuth 2.0, JWT, and Postman.
            <br /><br />
            I focus on writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code, and I thrive in seeing projects evolve from idea to deployment, especially using CI/CD workflows and cloud-native solutions.
            <br /><br />
            Outside of work, I actively contribute to open-source projects, participate in developer communities, and enjoy tackling coding challenges. I believe innovation is best driven through thoughtful collaboration. Let’s connect.
